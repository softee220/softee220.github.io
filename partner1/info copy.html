        <h1>Our History<h1>
            <p>Brandy Mellive was founded in Italy in the early 1980s 
           by a father and son duo, Silvio and Stephan Marsan.</p>

            <p>The brand was created to sell California-style attire.</p>

            <p>The first store in the US was in 2009, in Los Angeles 
            California. The name is inspired by a fictional story of an American girl
             named brandy and an English boy named Melville.</p>
