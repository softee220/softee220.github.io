        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <img src="brandysign.jpeg" class="brandysign"> 
            <p>Brandy Mellive was founded in Italy in the early 1980s 
           by a father and son duo, Silvio and Stephan Marsan.
           The brand was created to sell California-style attire. The first store in the US was in 2009, in Los Angeles 
            California. The name is inspired by a fictional story of an American girl
            named brandy and an English boy named Melville.</p>
