    <h2>Dining on Campus</h2>
    <p>Penn State offers a wide variety of places where you can use your meal plan — from dining halls in each dorm area to Starbucks, Panera Bread, and other locations across campus. Meal plans are priced based on your usable amount plus a base cost. Although you get up to 65% off at dining halls, the real discount may not be that significant. I personally focused on using meal plans where discounts apply.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Note: Starbucks at the HUB does not offer a discount, but the ones inside dorm area convenience stores (like Edge) do!</li>
      <li>Dining halls are available in West, North, East, South, and Pollock areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dining Halls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pollock Dining Hall:</strong> Widest menu variety with a great salad bar. “Today’s Soup” sometimes includes clam chowder and other tasty options.</li>
      <li><strong>West Dining Hall:</strong> Famous for delicious pizza and cookies!</li>
      <li><strong>North, East, South:</strong> Smaller with fewer options compared to Pollock and West.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Craving Asian Food?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Panda Express in the HUB</li>
      <li>Pollock Asian Kitchen (inside Pollock convenience store)</li>
      <li>Shin Ramyun, pho, and Asian snacks (like banana milk, mochi) at dorm convenience stores — Pollock has the most variety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Around Campus</h2>
    <p>University Park is a huge campus — walking from one end to the other can take over 30 minutes. 
      Fortunately, free campus buses like White Loop (WL), Blue Loop (BL), and Red Link (RL) run frequently. 
      From West dorms to the IM Building in East, walking takes 25+ minutes, but the loops get you there fast. 
    </p>

    <h2>Sport Games to Watch</h2>
    <p>Ice Hockey, Wrestling, Basketball, Baseball, and Volleyball games etc are frequently held. 
      If you're here during Spring Semester, I strongly recommend watching an Ice Hockey match — it’s thrilling! 
      While missing Football is unfortunate, Spring still offers many exciting games.</p>
