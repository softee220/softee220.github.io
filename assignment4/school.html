    <h2>Course Registration & Classes</h2>
    <p>I chose my classes based on professor reviews from RateMyProfessor and the Penn State official site. 
      You can find all available classes on LionPATH Class Search — there are literally thousands! 
      At first, I registered for 18 credits, but later dropped a major course and added a sports course to have a more relaxed semester. 
      Some classes are really heavy on workload, so I recommend balancing your schedule wisely.</p>

    <h2>Campus Facilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IM Building:</strong> The largest fitness center on campus. Offers gym, climbing, pickleball, badminton, and more. You can rent all equipment for free at the counter. I fell in love with pickleball and played almost every week! It's a fun, beginner-friendly sport.</li>
      <li><strong>Other gyms:</strong> White Building and Rec Hall, with Rec Hall located right across from West dorms.</li>
      <li><strong>Arboretum:</strong> Perfect for walks, sunset views, and snowball fights. There's also the Palmer Art Museum nearby. I went here often for a breath of fresh air.</li>
